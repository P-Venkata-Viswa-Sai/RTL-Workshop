# Baby Soc fundamentals and functional modelling
This is the second week of RTL workshop where we are going to discuss about SoC fundamentals
##  What is a System-on-Chip (SoC)?
System of chip in short is a chip that contains almost main parts of a motherboard of a laptop or deskatop in a small area compared to the laptop. With this we can easily fit the modules easily in a small area for smart phones so that they are easily portable. 
### Advantages of it are :-
- Reduces power consuption and area because they are spaced together.
- Improves performance and Lowers cost.
- Easily portable and makes life easy.
- There will be efficient memory transfor between components.

## Key components of SoC 
### 1. CPU (Central Processing Unit)
   - It is the main part of SoC.
   - It handles all instructions, mathematical calculations, like a bridge of all other components.
### 2. GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)
   - It rapidly accelerates the computer graphics. It gives good resolution for video games and increase the experience of it.
### 3. DSP (Digital Signal Processing)
   - It involves in processing of Audio, Video and display related functions.
### 4. Memory
   - It involves two components RAM and ROM.
   - RAM is related to for temparary storage of data while processing.
   - ROM involves the storage of date wherever power is given to him.
### 5. Power Managemnet
   - It gives the power to all the components of the SoC so that it performs efficiently.
### 6. Other components
   - These includes modules like wifi, bluetooth, Camera, Location,.. etc.

## Why BabySoC?  
BabySoc is like a model for SoC where we can easily experiment and understand how the operations are happening.
- **Simplified model** for beginners.  
- Contains only **essential blocks** (CPU + small memory + I/O).  
- Avoids industrial-level complexity.  
- Acts as a **stepping stone** before RTL & physical design.

## Role of Functional Modelling  
Functional modelling is done **before RTL and physical design** to ensure the SoC works logically.  
-  Verifies CPU–memory–peripheral interactions.  
-  Detects design flaws early.  
-  Runs faster than detailed RTL simulations.  
-  Serves as a **blueprint** for RTL coding.

## Conclusion  
BabySoC helps learners **grasp SoC fundamentals** in a simplified way.  
Functional modelling ensures correctness and reduces risk before moving to RTL and physical design.  
It is the **first step in the SoC design journey**.
